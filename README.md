# Statistics-for-Data-Science-with-Python
I've completed my final assignment for IBM's "Statistics for Data Science with Python" course. The assignment revolves around analyzing a housing dataset.

For this task, I employed various statistical techniques including t-tests, ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and regression analysis. Additionally, I utilized descriptive statistics and created visualizations to support my findings.

My toolkit consisted of Python libraries such as Seaborn, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and Statsmodels.
